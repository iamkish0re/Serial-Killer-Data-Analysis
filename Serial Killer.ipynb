After his 1981 conviction police investigated 60 unsolved murders and attempted murders across Britain they thought Sutcliffe could be responsible for, but were able to eliminate him from 40.[145] He has since also been linked by several investigators to the murder of Carol Wilkinson, for which an innocent man spent many years in prison for.[146][147] Sutcliffe died in hospital on 13 November 2020 at age 74, after being diagnosed with COVID-19.[148]</td>\n",

In 2015 former detective George Platt published a book about Kelly claiming he could be responsible for 31 murders, prompting the chief of the Metropolitan Police Bernard Hogan Howe to promise a re-investigation into his crimes. However, in 2019 Irish journalist Robert Mullhern published a book raising serious questions about Platt's claims, concluding that Kelly was only responsible for 5 or 6 murders.[464][465]</td>\n",

Pacciani was scheduled for retrial in 1998 when he died after taking medication contraindicated to his heart problems. Pacciani's two alleged accomplices, Mario Vanni and Giancarlo Lotti, were sentenced to life and 30 years in prison, respectively. Some believe that none of the accused were guilty, and that Lotti incriminated himself and the other two because he was homeless and wanted to live in prison.[129][130]  \n",

Owing to the modus operandi and location of the murders, Sutcliffe became known as the \"Yorkshire Ripper.\"[144] Sentenced to 20 concurrent life sentences. After three years he was sent to a secure psychiatric facility, where he served 25 years before being found \"fit to leave\" in 2009. Government officials and courts ruled in 2010 that he would never be released. In 2015, he was declared \"no longer mentally ill\", and transferred to a maximum security prison. After his 1981 conviction police investigated 60 unsolved murders and attempted murders across Britain they thought Sutcliffe could be responsible for, but were able to eliminate him from 40.[145] He has since also been linked by several investigators to the murder of Carol Wilkinson, for which an innocent man spent many years in prison for.[146][147] Sutcliffe died in hospital on 13 November 2020 at age 74, after being diagnosed with COVID-19.[148]  \n",

Other methods employed were hitting their heads with a heavy object (like a wooden stool) and electrocution (which was unsuccessful). He robbed and killed a couple before abandoning their corpses at Seletar Reservoir on 30 June 1983 and then, on 23 July 1983, killed three more people at Andrew Road. He was arrested and indicted for murder six days later and was sentenced to death on 14 August 1985; he lost an appeal and he was hanged on 9 December 1988.[312]  \n",

The latter was also decapitated and eviscerated in a manner strongly similar to 26 unsolved murders of women in Florida, starting in 1973, the year Brandt moved to the state. Brandt was later considered the culprit in one of these murders, due to his strong resemblance to a suspect who was filmed by a traffic camera near the place where one body was found. He could not be officially tied to the other crimes due to lack of evidence. Previously, when he was 13 years old in 1971, he attempted to murder his whole family with a gun, for no apparent reason. His mother (who was pregnant) died in this attack, but his father survived, and his sister escaped.[314]  \n",

He also dismembered their bodies and dumped them in various areas, such as the sea or abandoned places. Martin was also alleged to have killed at least three more people in other countries, such as the USA, but these were unconfirmed. He was arrested in Changi Airport when he returned to Singapore on 19 March 1995, and was charged with murder. Martin was found guilty of the one murder he committed in Singapore and thus sentenced to death in November 1995. Martin was executed on 19 April 1996, after he declined to appeal against his sentence.[356]  \n",

Committed suicide, \"probably in late 1940s or in early 1950s\". As information on this serial killer was only revealed by a police officer in 2018 during a conversation with a Brazilian writer, and there is no information on his conviction, the confirmation that he was a serial killer is debatable.  \n",

Garavito confessed to killing 140 boys between six and sixteen years old, from October 1992 to April 1999 in Colombia and neighboring countries. He is suspected of murdering over 300 victims, mostly street children. Garavito was originally sentenced to 1,853 years in prison, but this was later reduced to 22 years, after he led police to many of the bodies of his victims.
