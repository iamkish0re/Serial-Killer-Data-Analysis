# Serial Killer Database Analysis

In this project, we will analyze a database of serial killers taken from a Wikipedia table. We will perform data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Python and its libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset was taken from the Wikipedia table "List of serial killers by number of victims". To access the dataset, simply navigate to the table on the Wikipedia page and copy the table into a CSV file.

## Libraries Used

We will be using the following libraries for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis in our Jupyter Notebook:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Please make sure these libraries are installed before running the Jupyter Notebook.

## Analysis

In our Jupyter Notebook, we will perform the following analyses on the dataset:

- Cleaning the data and transforming it into a workable format.
- Exploring the distribution of victims among serial killers.
- Investigating the most common methods and motives of serial killers.
- Examining the geographic distribution of serial killers.
- Identifying any trends or patterns in the data.

By performing these analyses, we hope to gain a better understanding of the characteristics and behaviors of serial killers.

## Conclusion

This project provides a fascinating insight into the world of serial killers, and sheds light on the methods, motives, and distribution of these heinous crimes. We hope that this analysis will contribute to a greater understanding of the psychology of serial
